Main branches are the same as the app environments: 
  1. development \
    all code is written here \
  2. staging \
    after an approved pull requests gets here \
  3. production \
    after it has been tested gets here \n
Each branch should be named like so: \
  * feature/[id-feature]_[id-title] 
  * bug/[bug-name] 
  * research/[research-name] \
    All of this should have as parent branch 'development' !
