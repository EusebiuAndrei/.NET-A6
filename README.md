Main branches are the same as the app environments: \
&nbsp;&nbsp; development \
    - all code is written here \
  # staging \
    - after an approved pull requests gets here \
  # production \
    - after it has been tested gets here \
Each branch should be named like so: \
  # feature/[id-feature]_[id-title] \
  # bug/[bug-name] \
  # research/[research-name] \
  # All of this should have as parent branch 'development' ! \
